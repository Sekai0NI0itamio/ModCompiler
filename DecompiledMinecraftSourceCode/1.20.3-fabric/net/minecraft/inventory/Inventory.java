/**
 * A container of {@link ItemStack}s. In general, when a player stores an item stack
 * and can retrieve the same item stack back, that stack is stored in an
 * inventory. The inventory can be persistent, like chests or donkeys, or it can
 * be created without backing storage, like the slots in crafting tables.
 * It is the responsibility of the user to sync or save the contents of the
 * inventory.
 * 
 * <p>Entities and block entities that can hold item stacks generally
 * implement this interface themselves, allowing hopper interactions. Call {@link
 * net.minecraft.entity.player.PlayerEntity#getInventory} to get the player's
 * inventory (including armors and offhand).
 * 
 * <p>An inventory has a fixed size, and each element in the inventory is identified
 * by the slot number, which is between zero and {@code size() - 1} like arrays.
 * When a slot of the inventory is empty, it should be filled with {@link
 * ItemStack#EMPTY}.
 * 
 * <p>An implementation of this interface should have a field of {@link
 * net.minecraft.util.collection.DefaultedList#ofSize(int, Object)} with the second
 * argument as {@link ItemStack#EMPTY}, and implement methods by delegating to the
 * list. The list itself should not be modified directly, and the list's size
 * should remain constant throughout the lifetime of the inventory.
 * Implementations must call {@link #markDirty} when the inventory is modified.
 * 
 * @apiNote If an inventory is needed for temporary storage, use {@link
 * SimpleInventory}. For persistent storage in entities or block entities,
 * use {@link net.minecraft.entity.vehicle.VehicleInventory} or
 * {@link net.minecraft.block.entity.LockableContainerBlockEntity}.

 * @see net.minecraft.entity.vehicle.VehicleInventory
